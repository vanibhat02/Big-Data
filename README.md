## Introduction

Developed a California housing market application as part of his project, which streamlines the process of finding the ideal property by utilizing predictive analytics to determine the prices of houses based on customer's specific buying criteria. Additionally, I introduced the concept of how the presence of top-rated public schools in the vicinity can positively impact property values, further enhancing the utility of the application.
